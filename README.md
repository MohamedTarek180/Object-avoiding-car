# Arduino Robotics Project
This repository hosts the code and documentation for an Arduino-based robotics project. The project utilizes an Arduino Uno board combined with a motor shield and an ultrasonic sensor to navigate and interact with its environment. This setup is ideal for anyone interested in developing basic robotics projects using Arduino.
# Components
Arduino Uno: The central control board for the project.
L293D Motor Shield: Used to drive multiple motors.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Allows the robot to detect obstacles.
9V Battery: Powers the Arduino Uno.
Four 1.5V Batteries: Provide additional power for the motor shield.
Female to Female Wires: Used to connect components together without soldering.
# Features
Obstacle Detection: Uses the ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles.
Motor Control: Manages motor operations via the motor shield, allowing precise movements.
Modular Design: Easy to assemble and modify with minimal wiring.
